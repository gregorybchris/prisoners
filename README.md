# 100 Prisoners Simulation

## Background

This project was a collaboration with [Max Bernstein](https://github.com/tekknolagi/) and [Yuki Zaninovich](https://github.com/yzan424). After watching this [minutephysics video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eivGlBKlK6M), we decided to code up a simulation to explain the [100 prisoners problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_prisoners_problem).

## Running the Simulation

Run a single simulation for 10 iterations with the command `python experiment.py`.

To visualize the results of many simulations with different parameter settings run `python viz.py`.
